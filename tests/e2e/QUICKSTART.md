# E2E Tests Quick Start

## Installation

```bash
# Install all dependencies including Playwright
npm install

# Install Playwright browsers (chromium, firefox, webkit)
npx playwright install
```

## Running Tests

### Run all E2E tests
```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

### Run specific test file
```bash
npx playwright test signup.spec.ts
npx playwright test login.spec.ts
npx playwright test channels.spec.ts
npx playwright test messaging.spec.ts
```

### Run with UI mode (recommended for development)
```bash
npm run test:e2e:ui
```

### Run in headed mode (see browser)
```bash
npm run test:e2e:headed
```

### Debug mode
```bash
npm run test:e2e:debug
```

### Run on specific browser
```bash
npm run test:e2e:chromium
npm run test:e2e:firefox
npm run test:e2e:webkit
```

**Total: 1,300+ lines of test code**

## Key Features

### Mock Relay
- Full Nostr protocol simulation
- WebSocket server
- Event storage and retrieval
- Subscription management
- NIP-42 AUTH support
- Filter matching

### Test Data
- Consistent BIP-39 test mnemonic
- Deterministic key generation
- Mock channel data
- Realistic message scenarios

### Best Practices
- Clean state per test
- Proper element waiting
- Data-testid selectors
- Accessibility testing
- Parallel execution
- Screenshot on failure
- Trace on retry

## Troubleshooting

### Tests fail to start
```bash
# Reinstall Playwright browsers
npx playwright install --force
```

### Port already in use
The mock relay uses port 8081. If it's in use:
1. Stop the process using port 8081
2. Or modify `mock-relay.ts` to use a different port

### Application not loading
Ensure the dev server is running:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Browser not opening in headed mode
Check that you have installed browsers:
```bash
npx playwright install chromium firefox webkit
```

## Next Steps

1. **Integrate with CI/CD**: Add tests to GitHub Actions or other CI
2. **Add more tests**: Expand coverage for edge cases
3. **Performance testing**: Add tests for load and performance
4. **Visual regression**: Add screenshot comparison tests
5. **API mocking**: Enhance mock relay with more scenarios
